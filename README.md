# Work-Scheduler
Created by Siddharth Desai

## Description

The reasoning behind this project is to create a daily planner to  keep track of my daily task. The design is using hour time blocks with the option to save the input text to local storage. By saving it to local storage I am able to get retrieve the data and render it onto the page as long as the local storage is not cleared. In addition, the user is able to see the current time with a red background, past time slots in gray, and future time slots in green.
